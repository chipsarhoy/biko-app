## Overview
Independent project created to learn Django Rest Framework, React, and Bootstrap. Designed to be a
small Filipino Dessert business specializing on a Filipino rice cake dessert known as Biko.

## Current Update
Steadily working on the user views for ordering and selecting menu items, prioritizing functionality over styling.
Will soon implement bootstrap to handle styling for cross device compatability and also integrate an admin/business
view to view and fulfill orders and transactions.
